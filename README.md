# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns with Excel
Performing analysis on kickstarters data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project: An Analysis Of Campaign Outcomes Based on Launch Dates and Funding Goals for Theater Projects.

### Purpose: Perform an analysis of campaign outcomes in order to provide insight for greater successful outcomes. 

## Analysis and Challenges: Data analysis indicating the success and failure based on dates and goals. Challenges: Creating meaningful graphs that show the relationship between success and failure rates.

## Results
- Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date:
Both the success and failure rate corresponds to the chosen launch dates. Spring and summer months indicate a greater success rate with peak success in the month of May.

- One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals:
The percentage of successful versus the percentage of failed do not correspond to the funding goals.

- There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs:
The outcomes based on goals provides little insight that could improve the success of future goals. The graph of the outcomes based on goals does not clearly indicate the number of successes based on the amount of the goal. Clearly, the outcomes based on goals table indicates that the greatest number of projects with smaller goals have a much greater success rate at reaching their goal. A graph on this data may provide more insight into setting goals for future projects.
